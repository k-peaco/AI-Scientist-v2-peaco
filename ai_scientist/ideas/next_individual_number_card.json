        "Title": "Impact of Gamification on My Number Card Adoption and Usage",
        "Short Hypothesis": "Integrating gamification elements into the My Number Card system will significantly increase user engagement, adoption rates, and proper usage, while reducing resistance and concerns.",
        "Related Work": "While gamification has been extensively studied in various fields such as education, marketing, and health (e.g., Hamari et al., 2014), its application in governmental digital identity systems remains largely unexplored. Existing literature focuses on privacy concerns, system efficiency, and exclusion issues of My Number Card, but not on user engagement strategies.",
        "Abstract": "The My Number Card system in Japan faces significant challenges in user adoption and engagement, partly due to privacy concerns, perceived complexity, and lack of immediate benefits. This research proposes the integration of gamification elements\u2014such as points, badges, leaderboards, and rewards\u2014into the My Number Card system to enhance user engagement and adoption rates. By leveraging motivational psychology and game design principles, we aim to transform the user experience and incentivize proper usage. This study will involve a mixed-methods approach, including user behavior analysis, surveys, and controlled experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of gamification strategies in increasing user engagement, adoption rates, and addressing user concerns. We will also analyze the potential risks, such as user manipulation and privacy issues, to provide a balanced view of the approach.",

        "Risk Factors and Limitations": [
            "User Manipulation: There is a risk that users might game the system to earn rewards without genuine engagement.",
            "Privacy Concerns: Adding gamification elements might raise additional privacy concerns among users.",
            "Generalizability: The findings might not be directly applicable to other digital identity systems in different cultural contexts.",
            "Implementation Costs: Developing and maintaining a gamified system might incur additional costs."
