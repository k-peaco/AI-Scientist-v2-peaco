        "Title": "Enhancing Digital ID Adoption through Gamified Incentives and Privacy-Enhanced Design",
        "Short Hypothesis": "Integrating gamified incentives with robust privacy-enhanced designs in digital ID systems will significantly improve user adoption and engagement, addressing both motivational and privacy concerns.",
        "Related Work": "Prior research has identified privacy concerns and lack of immediate benefits as barriers to digital ID adoption (Xia et al., 2023; Yilma, 2022). Gamification has been shown to enhance user engagement in various domains, such as language learning (Charunin et al., 2024). However, there is limited research on the combined effect of gamification and privacy-enhanced designs in digital ID systems, making this proposal novel and impactful.",
        "Abstract": "Digital identification systems face significant challenges in user adoption due to privacy concerns and perceived lack of immediate benefits. This proposal aims to explore the potential of integrating gamified incentives with robust privacy-enhanced designs to address these challenges. By incorporating elements such as points, badges, and rewards for system use, alongside advanced privacy-preserving techniques, we hypothesize that user engagement and adoption rates can be significantly improved. We will conduct a series of controlled experiments and user surveys to test our hypothesis, measuring adoption rates, user satisfaction, and privacy perceptions. Our research will contribute to a deeper understanding of how to design more effective and user-friendly digital ID systems.",
