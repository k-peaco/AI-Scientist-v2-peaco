Both loss curves exhibit a consistent downward trend, with validation loss closely tracking train loss, which suggests good generalization. The convergence of the loss values around epoch 18 further confirms that the model is learning effectively and is not overfitting. The steady decrease in loss indicates that the training process is stable and efficient.","plot_path":"experiments/2025-10-05_14-28-37_gamified_my_number_card_attempt_0/logs/0-run/experiment_results/experiment_c065e40334d3428889a12534f7dd4a79_proc_64552/relu_activation_loss_curves.png"}],"vlm_feedback_summary":"The plots collectively demonstrate that the model achieves stable and high performance with the ReLU activation function.

No issues were identified in the implementation or execution.","exp_results_dir":"experiments/2025-10-05_14-28-37_gamified_my_number_card_attempt_0/logs/0-run/experiment_results/experiment_1ebda040eeef4bd9b0c723c44e66bccc_proc_64552","metric":{"value":{"metric_names":[{"metric_name":"training loss","lower_is_better":true,"description":"The loss computed on the training dataset.","data":[{"dataset_name":"20_epochs","final_value":0.2071,"best_value":0.2071},{"dataset_name":"50_epochs","final_value":0.1742,"best_value":0.1742}]},{"metric_name":"validation loss","lower_is_better":true,"description":"The loss computed on the validation dataset.","data":[{"dataset_name":"20_epochs","final_value":0.2184,"best_value":0.2184},{"dataset_name":"50_epochs","final_value":0.1911,"best_value":0.1911}]},{"metric_name":"validation adoption rate","lower_is_better":false,"description":"The adoption rate computed on the validation dataset.","data":[{"dataset_name":"20_epochs","final_value":0.9,"best_value":0.9},{"dataset_name":"50_epochs","final_value":0.905,"best_value":0.905}]}]},"maximize":null,"name":null,"description":null},"is_buggy":false,"is_buggy_plots":false,"parent_id":null,"children":[],"plot_data":{},"plots_generated":false,"plots":["../../logs/0-run/experiment_results/experiment_1ebda040eeef4bd9b0c723c44e66bccc_proc_64552/20_epochs_loss_curves.png","../../logs/0-run/experiment_results/experiment_1ebda040eeef4bd9b0c723c44e66bccc_proc_64552/50_epochs_loss_curves.png","../../logs/0-run/experiment_results/experiment_1ebda040eeef4bd9b0c723c44e66bccc_proc_64552/20_epochs_adoption_rate.png","../../logs/0-run/experiment_results/experiment_1ebda040eeef4bd9b0c723c44e66bccc_proc_64552/50_epochs_adoption_rate.png","../../logs/0-run/experiment_results/experiment_1ebda040eeef4bd9b0c723c44e66bccc_proc_64552/training_results.png"],"plot_paths":["experiments/2025-10-05_14-28-37_gamified_my_number_card_attempt_0/logs/0-run/experiment_results/experiment_1ebda040eeef4bd9b0c723c44e66bccc_proc_64552/20_epochs_loss_curves.png","experiments/2025-10-05_14-28-37_gamified_my_number_card_attempt_0/logs/0-run/experiment_results/experiment_1ebda040eeef4bd9b0c723c44e66bccc_proc_64552/50_epochs_loss_curves.png","experiments/2025-10-05_14-28-37_gamified_my_number_card_attempt_0/logs/0-run/experiment_results/experiment_1ebda040eeef4bd9b0c723c44e66bccc_proc_64552/20_epochs_adoption_rate.png","experiments/2025-10-05_14-28-37_gamified_my_number_card_attempt_0/logs/0-run/experiment_results/experiment_1ebda040eeef4bd9b0c723c44e66bccc_proc_64552/50_epochs_adoption_rate.png","experiments/2025-10-05_14-28-37_gamified_my_number_card_attempt_0/logs/0-run/experiment_results/experiment_1ebda040eeef4bd9b0c723c44e66bccc_proc_64552/training_results.png"],"plot_analyses":[{"analysis":"The loss curves indicate that both training and validation loss decrease steadily over the 20 epochs.
